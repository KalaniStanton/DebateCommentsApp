# Debate Comments App

**Abstract**
This shiny app employs a few methods for visualizing the data provided by Ventura, Munger, McCabe and Chang (2021) that they discuss in their paper titled "Connective Effervescence and Streaming Chat During Political Debates." This paper discusses the semantic expressions and social dynamics within live discussions surrounding the presidential debates that preceded the 2020 election. An interactive visualization is particularly suited for this dataset due to the sheer size and semantic complexity of the domain that it encapsulates. To this end, we visualize the most frequently used words and punctuation marks using wordclouds, the proportion of "likes" associated with each sentiment across network livestream pages, and an interactive bigram network to show common word co-occurences. Additionally, we chose to incorporate an visualization for evaluating the moral sentiment present within these data by way of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (Frimer et al., 2019).
